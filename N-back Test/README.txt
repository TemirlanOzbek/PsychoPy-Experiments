N-back task
--------------

The experiment:
	
	In this experiment participants are required to respond whenever the stimulus (square) location matches its location the previous trial (N-back-1). N-back-2 trials involve responding whenever the location of the square is the same as its location 2 trials before. This task is based on Kirchner (1958) experiment. This experiment differs from the original experiment in number of trials.
